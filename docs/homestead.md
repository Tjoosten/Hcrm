 ## homestead

Laravel Homestead is an official, pre-packaged Vagrant box that provides you a wonderful development environment without requiring you to install PHP, HHVM, a web server, and any other server software on your local machine. No more worrying about messing up your operating system! Vagrant boxes are completely disposable. If something goes wrong, you can destroy and re-create the box in minutes!

Homestead runs on any Windows, Mac, or Linux system 

### includes 

- Ubuntu 16.04
- Git
- PHP 7.0
- HHVM
- Nginx
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- Sqlite3
- Postgres
- Composer
- Node (With PM2, Bower, Grunt, and Gulp)
- Redis
- Memcached
- Beanstalkd


run the **vagrant up** command in your terminal and access your project at http://homestead.app in your browser.
Remember, you will still need to add an **/etc/hosts** file entry for homestead.app or the domain of your choice.
